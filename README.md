# flaskblog

## Purpose
This app was created by following a tutorial series on the *Flask* framework. I wanted to get a quick but comprehensive start into the framework and a starting point for further explorations. 

The app provides a basic multi user blog functionality, which includes:
- user management with registration, password reset, login/logout
- a main page for all posts, ordered by date
- pages for posts by specific users
- user profiles, with name and image editing features
